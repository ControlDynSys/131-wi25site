## Class Description
Basic system concepts; state-space and I/O representation. Properties of linear systems, including stability, performance, robustness. Reachability, observability, minimality, state and output-feedback. Brief introduction to optimal control and control of networked and nonlinear systems. Motivating case studies from tech, biology, neuroscience, and medical systems.

## Prerequisites
Students are expected to have a strong background in linear algebra. Additional background in control systems and real analysis are helpful, but not strictly necessary.

## Desired Course Outcomes
The primary objective of this course is to develop the fundamental concepts of linear systems theory, within the larger scope of control theory. In particular, concepts such as stability, controllability, and control design will be developed within the domain of linear systems, with a view towards more general settings. Students who complete CDS 131 should have a solid understanding of the core concepts of control theory and how to apply them in the linear setting.
