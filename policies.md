# Presentation of Course Material

## Overview
Each week, there will be three hours of lecture, covering all of the material offered for the class. A Piazza page will be created for students to discuss homeworks. 

## Lecture
Lecture will be on Monday and Wednesday from 1-2:30 PM in Annenberg 314.

## Homeworks
Homeworks will be assigned weekly and turned in on Canvas. Collaboration on homeworks is encouraged! Homeworks will be graded on a completion basis, with full points being awarded if effort is demonstrated on the assigned questions. Typically, assignments will contain a selection of exercises (easier) and problems (more challenging). To receive full credit for a homework, you must complete at least three total exercises, problems, or some combination thereof. Students planning on working in control or taking a qualifying exam in the subject are encouraged to try every question - although only three questions are required, the entire assignment is designed to be comfortably completed in a week.

A first (and optional) homework (titled homework 0), will be be assigned in the first week of classes, and can be used to evaluate your preparation for the math used in the course.
