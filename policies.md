# Presentation of Course Material

## Overview
Each week, there will be three hours of lecture, covering all of the material offered for the class. A Piazza page will be created for students to discuss homeworks. 

## Lecture
Lecture will be on Monday and Wednesday from 1-2:30 PM in Annenberg 314.

## Homeworks
Homeworks will be assigned weekly and turned in on Canvas. Collaboration on homeworks is encouraged! Homeworks will be graded on a completion basis, with full points being awarded if effort is demonstrated on the assigned questions. Typically, assignments will contain a selection of exercises (easier) and problems (more challenging).
