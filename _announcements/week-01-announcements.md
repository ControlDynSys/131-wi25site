title: Week 1 - Welcome!
---

We're extremely excited to have you! It's going to be a great semester. We've spent a lot of time revamping the content, and we hope you will gain a lot out of this advanced robotics course. 106B/206B really pushes the envelope by diving into open research problems, building off the foundation established by 106A/206A. 

**This week:**
- Optional [Homework 0](https://controldynsys.github.io/131-wi25site/assets/hw/hw0.pdf) released (due 1/24)
